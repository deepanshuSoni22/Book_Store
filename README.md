# Book Store

## College Final Project: Online Bookstore

This project is a web application built with Django that functions as an online bookstore or digital content platform. It allows users to upload, browse, purchase, and time-borrow digital books (primarily PDFs). Payment processing is integrated using Razorpay.

This project was developed as a final project for Soundarya Institute of Management and Science - BCA.

## ‚ú® Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure signup, login, and logout.
* **Book Catalog:** Browse a list of all uploaded books.
* **Book Details:** View detailed information about each book, including author, prices, and availability (purchase/borrow).
* **Book Upload:** Authenticated users can upload new books (PDF format).
* **Purchase:** Users can purchase books for permanent download access via Razorpay.
* **Time-Based Borrowing:** Users can borrow books for a defined period (set by the uploader) for in-browser reading via Razorpay. Access expires automatically.
* **Secure Content Access:** Download/Read access is strictly controlled based on ownership, purchase status, or active borrow status.
* **In-Browser Reader:** Borrowed books can be read directly within the application (using PDF.js).
* **User Dashboard:** Uploaders can view their uploaded books, track purchase and borrow activity on their books, and see their total earnings from sales.
* **Razorpay Integration:** Seamless payment processing for purchases and borrows.

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.8+
* Git
* A Razorpay account (for testing payments)

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/deepanshuSoni22/Book-Store.git
    cd Book-Store
    ```
    

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    # On macOS/Linux:
    # source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Copy the example environment file and update it with your secret keys.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, **edit the `.env` file** and replace the placeholder values with your actual Django Secret Key and Razorpay API keys.
    ```dotenv
    # .env
    DJANGO_SECRET_KEY='<generate_your_secret_key>' # Find a Django Secret Key generator online
    DJANGO_DEBUG=True # Set to False for production-like testing
    DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS='localhost,127.0.0.1' # Add domains if deploying

    RAZORPAY_KEY_ID='rzp_test_...' # Your Razorpay Test Key ID
    RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET='your_test_secret' # Your Razorpay Test Key Secret

    # Optional: Database configuration if not using default SQLite
    # DB_NAME='<database_name>'
    # DB_USER='<database_user>'
    # DB_PASSWORD='<database_password>'
    # DB_HOST='<database_host>'
    # DB_PORT='<database_port>'
    ```

5.  **Apply migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6.  **Create a superuser (optional but recommended for admin access):**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to create an admin user.

7.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## üí° Usage
